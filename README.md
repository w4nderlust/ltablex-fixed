# ltablex-fixed
ltablex is a package for LaTeX that makes it possible to create tables that span across several pages automatically with a field type X, like tabularx, that adapts its size to the size of the content. Unfortunately if you add a caption, the table's max width is set to the width of the caption. This fixed version solves this problem.

The original ltablex by Anil Goel can be found on [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ltablex).
